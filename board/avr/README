There is no BROS port for AVR, but modules compile.

This directory contains scripts for building the modules for
AVR5 (for example Atmega2560). The purpose is to check that
everything compiles cleanly on this target which has 16-bit
integers. Note however that there is currently no BROS port for
AVR so linking and running is not possible.

Some things to work with when porting to AVR:
- Code (flash) and data (RAM) are in different address spaces so
  constant data (.rodata) has to be copied to RAM at init time.
  This includes the romtags.
- The runtime will depend on soft implementations of mul and div
  which should be fetched from external library, such as libgcc.
  GCC also inserts dependencies on __do_copy_data() from libgcc.
- If library jump tables take to much of RAM, then we could
  implement special versions of MakeLibrary and create libcall
  stubs which call the internal (in image) versions directly.
  That would sacrifice run-time patching with SetFunction()
  aswell as dynamic loading.
