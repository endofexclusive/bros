  - '+': Always print the number with a sign.
  - ' ': If first character is not a sign then prefix with

  - '0': Pad number with leading zeros.
- Minimum field width. The field will be wider if necessary. If
  the converted argument has fewer characters than the field
  width, it will be padded on the left, or right if left
  adjustement has been requested.
- A length modifier:
  - 'l', specifying that a following 'd', 'o', 'u', 'x', or 'X'
    conversion specifier applies to a long int or unsigned long

Only a limited number of system function may be called while the

IntLocks are typically implemented as a spin lock on SMP systems
and are useful for protecting invariants which must be accessed
in interrupt context. For managing data invariants whcih are
accessed in task context only, the Wait() based Mutex interface
may be a better choice.
