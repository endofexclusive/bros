About
=====

This directory contains scripts for building BROS toolchains
based on GNU Binutils and GCC.


Requirements
============

The following software has to be preinstalled in the system:

* curl
* Bash
* Texinfo
* Tex Live (pdflatex)
* GNU make
* Compiler for build system
* GCC build dependencies (see the GCC document _Installing GCC_)

To Install prerequisites in BSD systems:
  pkg install bash texinfo texlive-full gmake mpc
  pkg install gmp


Preparation
===========

Before building the tool chain for the first time, fetch and
patch the tool sources with this command:

  make -C ext extdep


Build
=====

Use the following command to build BROS tools from source:

  ./build.sh all aarch64 arm avr riscv sparc

Optionally, --nopdf, can be given on the command line to prevent
building documentation in PDF format, and thus eliminating the
pdflatex dependency.

The toolchains will be installed in the opt/bros-$arch-$ver
directories of the repository top-level directory. The
installataion directories can be soft-linked to any suitable
location. In either case, the installation directory bin should
be added to PATH.

You can test the installation like this:
  $ aarch64-all-bros-ld -v
  GNU ld (bros-aarch64-0.2.11) 2.39

A tar.gz archive is created for the installation and build log
files are located in the log directory.


Default multilib
================

* RISC-V: -march=rv32gc -mabi=ilp32d
  g is (2022-09-30) IMAFD, Zicsr, Zifencei
  In other words, -march=rv32imafd_zicsr_zifencei -mabi=ilp32d
